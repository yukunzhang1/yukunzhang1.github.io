I am currently serving as a Data Specialist Leader in LLM at Alipa <img src='./images/alipay1.png' style='width: 6em;'> , where I specialize in AI alignment and synthetic data. My work involves developing methodologies that enable AI to robustly follow human intent across a wide range of scenarios, particularly in AI regulation. This involves designing evaluation benchmarks, using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to generate synthetic data, and addressing full-stack policy problems to ensure AI systems are aligned with societal values.

Before I  worked at TikTok <img src='./images/Tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a senior data scientist in Dublin,ireland. focusing on AI fairness and algorithmic transparency. where I led efforts on AI governance and regulation, focusing on algorithmic fairness and transparency. My team developed an interpretable machine learning-based data product to provide insights into content moderation, addressing key concerns in government AI regulations. This experience enabled me to lead cross-functional teams to ensure that TikTok's algorithms align with both ethical standards and regulatory frameworks. 

I graduated from The Chinese University of Hong Kong with a master's degree, advised by [Duan Li (李端)](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~dli/) and [Nan Chen (陈南)](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~nchenweb/), and from The Shandong University of Finance and Economics with double bachelor degrees, advised by [Jianhua Ma (马建华)](https://gkgc.sdufe.edu.cn/info/1117/7102.htm) and [Jing Zhang (张晶)](https://jinrong.sdufe.edu.cn/info/1162/4587.htm). After completing my graduate studies, I embarked on a journey as a Research Assistant at the Chinese University of Hong Kong advised by [Lingfei Li (李凌飞)](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-li-lingfei/), delving into machine learning applications in finance for a year. 

My industry career began as a Data Scientist at JingDong.com, and my role at Alibaba as a Data Science Manager was pivotal in advancing my expertise in AI policy, particularly in the digital economy and e-commerce sectors. I led initiatives on online price and pricing regulation ,providing data product that benefitted small and medium-sized enterprises. At TikTok, I continue to lead data science efforts, focusing on responsible AI, algorithmic transparency, and mitigating platform risks related to fairness.

My research interests include AI policy,interpretable machine learning, digital economy, and LLM alignment.
