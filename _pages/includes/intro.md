I currently worked in  Alipay <img src='./images/alipay1.png' style='width: 6em;'> as Data science leader,My responsibilities includes developing  methods to understand large language models (LLMs) by explainable methods ,build tools to efficiently evaluate the effectiveness of novel LLM-generated agents, and monitor models for misaligned or potentially dangerous behavior, with a strong emphasis on leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Before I  worked at TikTok <img src='./images/Tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a senior data scientist in Dublin,ireland;

I graduated from The Chinese University of Hong Kong with a master's degree, advised by [Duan Li (李端)](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~dli/) and [Nan Chen (陈南)](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~nchenweb/), and from The Shandong University of Finance and Economics with double bachelor degrees, advised by [Jianhua Ma (马建华)](https://gkgc.sdufe.edu.cn/info/1117/7102.htm) and [Jing Zhang (张晶)](https://jinrong.sdufe.edu.cn/info/1162/4587.htm).

After completing my graduate studies, I embarked on a journey as a Research Assistant at the Chinese University of Hong Kong advised by [Lingfei Li (李凌飞)](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-li-lingfei/), delving into machine learning applications in finance for a year. Then I transitioned to a Data Scientist role at JingDong.com, marking the beginning of my industry journey in data science.

My tenure at Alibaba, as a Data Scientist Manager, was transformative. I established and led the first data science team dedicated to online pricing strategies and price regulation on ecommerce, significantly benefiting small and medium enterprises. At TikTok, I continue to lead data science efforts, focusing on Responsible AI such as algorithm fairness and LLM evaluation. I also lead team to develop interpretable machine learning product to enhance algorithm transparency and mitigate platform risks.

My research interests include interpretable machine learning, digital economy, and LLM alignment.
