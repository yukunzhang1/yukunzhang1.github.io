I am currently an LLM Data Leader at Alibaba, where I focus on building industrial-scale data pipelines for large language models and leading the design of data quality governance frameworks for multilingual and multimodal pre-training corpora.

Previously, I was a Senior Data Scientist Leader at TikTok <img src='./images/Tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> in Dublin, Ireland, where I led efforts on LLM evaluation, interpretable AI, and algorithmic governance to ensure compliance with ethical standards and regulatory frameworks. Before that, I served as a Data Science Manager at Alibaba, working on AI policy in the digital economy, including online pricing and data products for SMEs. I began my industry career as a Data Scientist at JD.com.

I hold a Master's degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Duan Li (李端)](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~dli/) and [Nan Chen (陈南)](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~nchenweb/), and double Bachelor's degrees from Shandong University of Finance and Economics. After my graduate studies, I spent a year as a Research Assistant at CUHK with [Lingfei Li (李凌飞)](https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/prof-li-lingfei/), working on machine learning applications in finance.
